# **The Kicks Fix**

***Image goes here***

## **Goal for this project**
Welcome to The Kicks Fix, your one stop destination for trainers, sneakers, gutties or kicks as I like to call them.
Navigate through the website and see if you can find the kicks that are meant for you from the wide selection available.
After you find the perfect pair, like Cinderella at the Ball, why not choose some accessories or invest in some TLC - Trainers Loving Care products
to maintain your purchase for as long as possible.
So come have a look and don't forget to register an account, for discounts and promotions !!!

Unfortunately, this is my final project which means I will have finished my course and this saddens me to be honest but I know this is my springboard to a better future.
I love coding and learning new things so for the last time, I am going to throw everything into this one and I hope you will all love it.
I have combined my love for Djing, retro games and vinyls into my first three projects so all that is left is my love for KICKS.
One of the first things my mentor ever said to me was design the website based on something that makes you happy which I have stuck to thus far.
I have a serious Kicks Addiction, hence my project name, and cannot stop buying them ha ha, even if I never wear them which also drives me crazy. I hate the fact that they
might get dirty but eventully I'll give in and wear them ..... the odd time and in dry weather too which means about two days a year in Ireland, lol. 

Anyways, thank you for checking my final project out and I really hope you love the overall feel of my website :)
