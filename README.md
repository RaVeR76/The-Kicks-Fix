# **The Kicks Fix**

***Image goes here***

## **Goal for this project**

Welcome to The Kicks Fix, your one stop destination for trainers, sneakers, gutties or kicks, as I like to call them.
Navigate through the website and see if you can find the kicks that are meant for you from the wide selection available.
After you find the perfect pair, like Cinderella at the Ball, why not choose some accessories or invest in some TLC - Trainers Loving Care products
to maintain your purchase for as long as possible.
So come have a look and don't forget to register for an account .... to take advantage of tailored discounts and promotions !!!

Unfortunately, this is my final project which means I will have finished my course and this saddens me to be honest but I know this is my springboard to a better future.
I love coding and learning new things so for the last time, I am going to throw everything into this one and I hope you will all love it.
I have combined my love for Djing, retro games and vinyls into my first three projects so all that is left is my love for KICKS.
One of the first things my mentor ever said to me was design the website based on something that makes you happy which I have stuck to thus far.
I have a serious Kicks Addiction, hence my project name, and cannot stop buying them ha ha, even if I never wear them which also drives me crazy. I hate the fact that they
might get dirty but eventully I'll give in and wear them ..... the odd time and in dry weather too which means about two days a year in Ireland, lol. 

And just so you know depending on your location around the world, you may have a different name for your athletic / casual footwear as mentioned above
so for the purposes of this project I will be calling them KICKS ! 
I know that in the UK they are generally called Trainers and in America they are generally called Sneakers or if you're really oldskool, like 19th century oldskool, you may call them Gutties .... which is what I grew up calling them to be honest but this is because I'm Irish ha ha. 

Sorry but I felt I had to clarify this before I continue, just to eliminate any confusion plus I feel **KICKS** is more universal and more down with the kids, nowadays !

Anyways, thank you for checking my final project out and I really hope you love the overall feel of my website :)

### **Design Choices**

#### Fonts

I think for fonts I need to keep this fairly simple because my website is going to be available to all ages so I need the font to be
really legible especially for kids. As per usual I have delved into my main source for fonts, the glorious [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
From the multitude of fonts I have settled on [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) for my titles / main headings and [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) for my main content. I just love the combination of these two which is the most important factor but their names come a close second for me.

Below is an example of my fonts where the title is in ***Lora*** and the text is in ***Poppins*** .....

#### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require. 
I will deffo be using the various basic icons and some shopping based icons on my website.
Other than that, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.

#### Colours

I have used the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website to come up with my colour scheme for this project and I love this wee website, as it has amazing combinations
already there for developers to utilise them.
As always though, I want to go for fairly bright colours as I want my website to be lively and standout but not too bright that it will hurt thy old eyes.
I deffo do not want boring colours that smell of depression or prison either !
Therefore, I went for the typical white and black but versions that are just slightly off colour. I also settled on a red and a yellow to brighten up the overall feel as mentioned above.

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....

So a better breakdown of the colours are shown below:

|Name                  |Hex Code   |Basic Description  |Usage                           |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
|***Cultured***        |#F5F5F5    |Off White          |Body background, text & titles  |
|***Minion Yellow***   |#FEE440    |Bright Yellow      |Body background                 |
|***Imperial Red***    |#E63746    |Brightish Red      |Body background                 |
|***Eerie Black***     |#121416    |Off Black          |Body background, text & titles  |

## **Wireframes**
---
The software that I used for my wireframes was Balsamiq. This was the fourth time I used this software & I really enjoy designing my project layouts using this. The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile. They are just simple 2D sketches but I now understand how important these really are :) 
I think my wireframes look good & deffo give me a great starting point for the design process !

Anyway, you can have a wee look at my wireframes below:

## **Database Structure**
---
For my database structure I had to think about this for a while hence why I have added before I'm about to start adding my models to my project.
To be honest it took me while to get my head around it but I think I got there. After watching the Code Institute tutorials again, endless Youtube videos and 
undeniable assistance from my lengendary mentor, I have produced my first Database Schema. I didn't lay one out for my MS3 which cost me valuable marks but for this project, I wasn't going to make the same mistake.
The Kicks Fix Schema is shown below where I have set up 14 models and have shown the various relationships between them. I may add more if required as my project develops
& I think of new features that can be implemented but these are the main models that my project needs and I am very happy with the structure.
I used [drawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) to construct my schema which is a free online app and really awesome, once you get the hang of it !
