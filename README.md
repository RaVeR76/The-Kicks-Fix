# **The Kicks Fix**

![The Kicks Fix](https://github.com/RaVeR76/The-Kicks-Fix/raw/main/docs/screenshots/readme-hero.png)

## **Goal for this project**

Welcome to The Kicks Fix, your one stop destination for trainers, sneakers, gutties or kicks, as I like to call them.
Navigate through the website and see if you can find the kicks that are meant for you from the wide selection available.
After you find the perfect pair, like Cinderella at the Ball, why not choose some accessories or invest in some TLC - Trainers Loving Care products
to maintain your purchase for as long as possible.
So come have a look and don't forget to register for an account .... to take advantage of tailored discounts and promotions !!!

Unfortunately, this is my final project which means I will have finished my course and this saddens me to be honest but I know this is my springboard to a better future.
I love coding and learning new things so for the last time, I am going to throw everything into this one and I hope you will all love it.
I have combined my love for Djing, retro games and vinyls into my first three projects so all that is left is my love for KICKS.
One of the first things my mentor ever said to me was design the website based on something that makes you happy which I have stuck to thus far.
I have a serious Kicks Addiction, hence my project name, and cannot stop buying them ha ha, even if I never wear them which also drives me crazy. I hate the fact that they
might get dirty but eventully I'll give in and wear them ..... the odd time and in dry weather too which means about two days a year in Ireland, lol. 

And just so you know depending on your location around the world, you may have a different name for your athletic / casual footwear as mentioned above
so for the purposes of this project I will be calling them KICKS ! 
I know that in the UK they are generally called Trainers and in America they are generally called Sneakers or if you're really oldskool, like 19th century oldskool, you may call them Gutties .... which is what I grew up calling them to be honest but this is because I'm Irish ha ha. 

Sorry but I felt I had to clarify this before I continue, just to eliminate any confusion plus I feel **KICKS** is more universal and more down with the kids, nowadays !

Anyways, thank you for checking my final project out and I really hope you love the overall feel of my website :)

### **User Requirements and Expectations**

#### Requirements 

* A landing page that when the user sees it they automatically think .... I need to see more please !!!

### **Design Choices**

#### Fonts

I think for fonts I need to keep this fairly simple because my website is going to be available to all ages so I need the font to be
really legible especially for kids. As per usual I have delved into my main source for fonts, the glorious [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
From the multitude of fonts I have settled on [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) for my titles / main headings and [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) for my main content. I just love the combination of these two which is the most important factor but their names come a close second for me.

Below is an example of my fonts where the title is in ***Lora*** and the text is in ***Poppins*** .....

![The-Kicks-Fix Fonts](https://github.com/RaVeR76/The-Kicks-Fix/raw/main/docs/screenshots/fonts.png)

#### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require. 
I will deffo be using the various basic icons and some shopping based icons on my website.
Other than that, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.

#### Colours

I have used the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website to come up with my colour scheme for this project and I love this wee website, as it has amazing combinations
already there for developers to utilise them.
As always though, I want to go for fairly bright colours as I want my website to be lively and standout but not too bright that it will hurt thy old eyes.
I deffo do not want boring colours that smell of depression or prison either !
Therefore, I went for the typical white and black but versions that are just slightly off colour. I also settled on a red and a yellow to brighten up the overall feel as mentioned above.

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....

![The-Kicks-Fix Colours](https://github.com/RaVeR76/The-Kicks-Fix/raw/main/docs/screenshots/colour-scheme.png)

So a better breakdown of the colours are shown below:

|Name                  |Hex Code   |Basic Description  |Usage                           |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
|***Cultured***        |#F5F5F5    |Off White          |Body background, text & titles  |
|***Minion Yellow***   |#FEE440    |Bright Yellow      |Body background                 |
|***Imperial Red***    |#E63746    |Brightish Red      |Body background                 |
|***Eerie Black***     |#121416    |Off Black          |Body background, text & titles  |

## **Wireframes**
---
The software that I used for my wireframes was Balsamiq. This was the fourth time I used this software and I really enjoy designing my project layouts using this. The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile. They are just simple 2D sketches but I now understand how important these really are :) 
I think my wireframes look good and deffo give me a great starting point for the design process !

Anyway, you can have a wee look at my wireframes below:

## **Database Structure**
---
For my database structure I had to think about this for a long time before I started my project.
To be honest it took me while to get my head around it but I think I got there. After watching the Code Institute tutorials again, endless Youtube videos and 
undeniable assistance from my lengendary mentor, I have produced my first Database Schema. I didn't lay one out for my MS3 which cost me valuable marks but for this project, I wasn't going to make the same mistake.
The Kicks Fix Schema is shown below where I have set up 15 models and have shown the various relationships between them. I may add more if required as my project develops
and I think of new features that can be implemented but these are the main models that my project needs and I am very happy with the structure.
I used [drawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) to construct my schema which is a free online app and really awesome, once you get the hang of it !

![The-Kicks-Fix Schema](https://github.com/RaVeR76/The-Kicks-Fix/raw/main/docs/screenshots/schema.png)


### **Database choice**

During the development, I worked with **sqlite3** databases, installed with Django.
For production, I've used a **PostgreSQL** database which is provided in Heroku as an add-on.

- The **User model** I have used in this project was provided by Django Allauth. It is a part of default `django.contrib.auth.models`.

### **Data Modelling Conclusion**

I struggled a little at the start with this but the more I got into the project I started to understand most of it and how it all worked. Don't get me wrong, I still have a lot to learn which will come when the pressure to meet the project deadline is off and I can test Django out at my own pace. I never got to utilise my Wishlist for the user to have their own personal wishlists or Social for ALL the social icons that I was going to link but I'll just add these to Features to be Implemented. I did try my best to add as much to the backend as possible like the logos, delivery costs, delivery threshold etc so that if any changes needed to be made for these, it would be much simplier.  
The more I play around and practise with Django and databases then the more confident and experienced I'll become, which is only a good thing, but while I had many head scratching evenings after work, I think the overall structure is okay and far from perfect but it works and that's the main aim here.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

## **Features**
---

### **Existing Features**

- Registration and login functionality using the Allauth package from Django, to keep it simple
- Good filtering within the Navbar dropdowns for finding specific Kicks quickly
- On each products details page, kicks or accessory, I have three images available that automatically scroll whilst you are there
- I have added kicks size selection for UK, EU and US that allows the user to select either and then changes the dropdown options to suit (also takes into account sex)
- The logged in user had a profile page for personal details and an order history page were they can view previous orders

### **Features To Be Implemented**

- Wishlist feature that I had originally wanted from the start
- Admin page for changing the landing image or logos which you can do through Django Admin, in the Home database
- Admin page for adding discounts and changing delivery costs which again you can do though Django Admin, in the Discounts database
- Registration by utilising Social accounts like Google or Facebook
- Different payments types like Paypal or GooglePay although Stripe works well
- Add the users DOB so that The Kicks Fix can send special birthday offers (another discount code like below) automatically by email, close to that date
- Utilise the discount code on the checkout page so that when a user inputs one, it checks it for validation, and then deducts the associated discount percentage from the total
- Add accessories to the search functionailty of the Nav Search Bar

## **Deployment**
---
### Local Deployment

I have created this project using Github, from there I used [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) to write my code, as I have for ALL four projects now. 
Then I used commits to git followed by "git push" to my GitHub repository. 
I've deployed this project to Heroku and used "git push heroku main" to make sure my pushes to GitHub were also made to Heroku. 

For this project you need to create an account on Stripe for the Checkout App, as well as an account on AWS in order to store your static and media files.

This project can be ran locally by following the following steps:   
I used Gitpod for development, so the following steps will be specific to Gitpod.  
You will need to adjust them depending on your IDE. You can find more information about installing packages using pip and virtual environments [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

To clone the project: 

1. From the application's repository, click the "code" button and download the zip of the repository.
    Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the following line in your terminal:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/RaVeR76/The-Kicks-Fix.git
    ``` 

1. Access the folder in your terminal window and install the application's [link to required modules](https://github.com/RaVeR76/The-Kicks-Fix/blob/main/requirements.txt) using the following command:
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. In your IDE, create a file containing your environmental variables called env.py at the root level of the application. 
    It will need to contain the following lines and variables:
    ```
    import os

    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"

    os.environ["DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL"] = 'DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL'

    os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"
    os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "STRIPE_WH_SECRET"
    os.environ["STRIPE_CURRENCY"] = "GPB"

    ```
    
    If you're not sure how to get the above Stripe variables, please visit the [Stripe Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs)

    If you plan on pushing this application to a public repository, ensure that env.py is added to your .gitignore file.

1. Migrate the database models with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```


1. Create a superuser and set up the credentials with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```


1. Run the app with the following command
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The address to access the website is displayed in the terminal  
    Add /admin to the end to access the Django Admin panel with your superuser credentials


### Heroku Deployment 

1. Login to your Heroku account and create a new app (best calling it the same or something similar to your project name). Choose your region. 


1. Once the app is created click on the resources button and under Add-ons, look for the Heroku Postgres to attach a postgres database to your project.
   Select the Hobby Dev - Free plan and click 'Submit order form'


1. Scroll back up and click "settings". Scroll down and click "Reveal config vars". Set up the same variables as in your ```env.py```.  
   You shouldn't set the **DEBUG** variable in under config vars, only in your ```env.py``` to prevent **DEBUG** being active on live website. 
    ```
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = "AWS_S3_REGION_NAME"
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = "AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME"
    USE_AWS = True
    
    DATABASE_URL = "This variable is automatically set when adding the Postgres Add on"

    SECRET_KEY = "SECRET_KEY"

    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = "STRIPE_WH_SECRET"
    STRIPE_CURRENCY = GPB

    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = "DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL"
    EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
    EMAIL_HOST_PASS = "EMAIL_HOST_PASS"
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = "EMAIL_HOST_USER"
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    ```

1. Make sure your manage.py file is connected to your mysql database like below
    ```
    DATABASES = {
                  'default': {
                      'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                      'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
                  }
              }
    ```

1. Use this command to backup your current database and load it into a db.json file:
    ```
    python3 manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
    ```

1. From your Heroku Config Vars, copy the value of DATABASE_URL


1. After this go to your settings.py in the *the_kicks_fix* directory and comment out the default database configuration shown above and add:
    ```
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse('Put your DATABASE_URL here'))
    }
    ```

1. Migrate again with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

1. Create a superuser for the postgres database so you can have access to the django admin by setting up the credentials with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    ** *Don't forget to login to the admin page and check the boxes 'Verified and Primary"* **


1. Load the data into your newly created database by using the following command: 
    ```
    python3 manage.py loaddata db.json
    ``` 

1. After migrations are complete, change database configurations to:
```
      if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
          DATABASES = {
              'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
          }
      else:
          DATABASES = {
              'default': {
                  'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                  'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
              }
          }
```
This set up will allow your site to use Postgres in deployment and sqlite3 in development.


1. Make sure you have your requirements.txt file and your Procfile. In case you don't, follow the below steps:
    Requirements:
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    Procfile:
    ```
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```

1. The Procfile should contain the following line:
    ```
    web: gunicorn <project_name>.wsgi:application

    ```

1. Add your files and commit them to GITHUB by running the following commands:
    ```
    git add . 
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push
    ```

1. Add your Heroku app URL to ALLOWED_HOSTS in your settings.py file


1. Disable collect static so that Heroku doesn't try to collect static files when you deploy by typing the following command in the terminal
    ```
    heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
    ```

1. Go back to HEROKU and click "Deploy" in the navigation. 


1. Scroll down to Deployment method and Select Github. 


1. Look for your repository and click connect. 


1. Under automatic deploys, click 'Enable automatic deploys'


1. Just beneath, click "Deploy branch". Heroku will now start building the app. When the build is complete, click "view app" to open it.


1. In order to commit your changes to the branch, use git push to push your changes. 


1. Store your static files and media files on AWS. You can find more information about this on [Amazon S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html).

1. Set up email service to send confirmation email and user verification email to the users. You can do this by following the next steps (Gmail only)

(Be aware that this migth be different for other providers or the process might have changed over time)

* Go to your email account and go to your account settings
* Under Security, scroll down to Signing in to Google and make sure 2 step verification is turned on
* Under the same heading (Signing in to Google) you will see the 'App passwords' option.
* Click on the option, select mail for the app and under device type select other and fill in 'Django'
* You will now get a password which you should copy and set it as a config variable in Heroku:

```
    EMAIL_HOST_PASS = 'Password you just copied'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'Your gmail account
```
* Go to your settings.py in *the_kicks_fix* directory and add the following:

```
    if "DEVELOPMENT" in os.environ:
        EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
        DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get('DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL')
    else:
        EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
        EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
        EMAIL_PORT = 587
        EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
        EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
        EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_PASS')
        DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
```

**The Kicks Fix** is now deployed on Heroku with AWS storing media files and static files ..... **ENJOY !!!**

## **Conclusion**
---

So the end is nigh ! .... and this is basically the last part of my project to do as I have completed everything else so I'll keep it short.   
At the start of this project, I spent a lot of time getting the images right and then I had to scroll through the internet for decriptions, SKUs, estimated prices etc etc. This took so much time to sort out which I didn't realise and deffo had a knock on effect by not getting everything I wanted within my website completed. Whilst some of the images aren't the best looking and the descriptions are so random, they are the best I could find, especially for the Accessories. It was hard work and very monotonous looking for all the info for the images that I had downloaded from Kaggle. The file was 8.46 Gb of kick images which I trawled through for the best sets I could. I had another folder from Kaggle which was only 383 Mb but there was only one image of each Kicks here and I really wanted the three for my wee carousel. Also spending all that time cutting, editing and resizing them all to 400x400 pixels deffo made the overall display look more universal with no odd shaped images throwing it all off tilt.   
There are a lot more Adidas Kicks than any other, a lot more Lifestyle styles than any other and prices may not just be right but you need to look past this at this point, as it's mainly about the code but I still don't want you to forget the effort in getting the data ha ha .... holy moly, there are even a pair of **Green Puma Rihanna sandals** threw in there for good measure ha ha !!!   
In the real world, this would be a job for another colleague to get these pics / images ready for the site so during this project not only was I the developer but also the graphic designer too ha ha. I even made the wee logo to go with it all.   

Just so you know how much effort I put into this project too, I have added PDF versions of my my Excel Spreadsheet that I kept a log of everything on, as I went along.  
There was my diary, my bugs, my Django model data, all my Kicks data and all my Accessory data that I gathered online .... all on one wee spreadsheet. Please check the various sections out below if you want:

- [The Kicks Fix - All Accessories Data](https://github.com/RaVeR76/The-Kicks-Fix/raw/main/docs/wireframes/kicks-fix-all-accessory-data.pdf)

At the end of the day, I have fully put my heart and soul into this project and sat for a month and a half every week night and ALL weekend EVERY weekend, trying to do the best that I could. Like I said whilst I didn't get some things completed that I wanted, like my Wishlist function, I am still so so happy with the overall look and functionality of my website. It actually looks like a proper **E-Commerce WEBSITE !!!**  

Anyway, as sad as it is, that this is my last Project on the course, and it is sad ... believe me, but I cannot believe how far I have came in a year. A year ago I didn't even know what HTML stood for, I still don't ha ha, only messing but what I have learned, the friends I have gained in the Slack community, my mentor who I adore and basically the whole Coding Community (such a clever bunch of people) .... I personally would not have gotten this far without **YOU ALL** !!!!   

So thank you to anyone who is reading this and if you helped me along the way (high five peeps) .... I really hope you enjoy this project because it's accumulated from a year of high, lows, tears, laughter, imposter syndrome, hating JavaScript then loving JavaScript, pesking extra commas, effort, hard work, dedication and so on ... you all know the score because you've all been there.  

Anyways, I'm off to watch TV because I haven't seen one for the last month and a half ha ha but listen ... deep down, I REALLY hope you enjoy ........ **THE KICKS FIX** !!!
